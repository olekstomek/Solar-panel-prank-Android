It is a simple application written for fun and for a joke. The application simulates the charging of the phone battery depending on the light intensity. If there is too little lighting, you see a message that the quality is low. If there is enough light intensity you will see battery charging animations (animation will be slow or fast depending on Lux (lx)).

You can change the graphics of the solar panel - it does not affect the behavior of the battery charging animation.

The application can manage the brightness of your smartphone screen, but you can also turn it off. The brightness adjustment is based on the fact that the brighter the surroundings, the brighter your smartphone screen will be. The darker the environment, the darker your smartphone screen will be.

You can also set the option that the screen does not turn off automatically after a certain time in your operating system (restart the application).
